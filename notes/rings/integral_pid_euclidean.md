# Notes on integral domains, principal ideal domains and Euclidean domains
Original motivation is to lay this out for linear algebra

## Definition of ring
A **ring** is a tuple $(R, +, \cdot)$ where $(R, +)$ is an abelian group, $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid, and $\cdot$ distributes over $+$.

A ring is **commutative** if its multiplication $\cdot$ is commutative (i.e. if the monoid is a commutative monoid).


## Definition of ring ideals
If $R$ is a ring, then $S \subseteq R$ is a **left ideal** iff

 - $0 \in S
 - $x, y \in S$ implies $x + y \in S$
 - for any $x \in S$ and for any $r \in R$, $rx \in S$

$S$ is a **right ideal** iff

 - $0 \in S
 - $x, y \in S$ implies $x + y \in S$
 - for any $x \in S$ and for any $r \in R$, $xr \in S$


$S$ is a **two-sided ideal** iff it is both a left ideal and a right ideal.

### Note
Every one-sided ideal of a commutative ring is a two-sided ideal.


## Definition of principal ideal
A **principal left ideal** for some ring $R$ is the left ideal generated by a single element of the ring: $\{ra : r \in R\}$ for some $a \in R$. **Principal right ideal** is defined similarly.


## Definition of an integral domain
A ring $R$ is an **integral domain** iff it is commutative and for all $a, b \in R - 0$, $ab \neq 0$. The latter condition is often stated as the ring having no *zero divisors*.


## Definition of a principal ideal domain
An integral domain $R$ in which every ideal $I$ is a principal ideal is called a **principal ideal domain**.
